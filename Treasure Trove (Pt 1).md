# üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è Challenge Overview (Treasure Trove (Pt 1)

**Challenge Name:** Treasure Trove (Pt 0)  
**File:** `trove`  
**Category:** Reverse Engineering  
**Tool Used:** Ghidra

## üìú Challenge Description

> This one sent Beckman for a loop, multiple loops really. Can you help save Benn's reputation in front of Shanks xor is it really that bad?

## üîç Initial Analysis

Upon loading the binary into Ghidra, we observed the following logic in `main()`:

```c
    local_c = 0;
    while( true ) {
    if (0xb < local_c) {
      for (local_10 = 0; local_a8[local_10] != 0; local_10 = local_10 + 1) {
        local_a8[local_10] = local_b4[0] ^ local_a8[local_10];
      }
      printf("Flag: %s\n",local_a8);
      return 0;
    }
    if (local_e8[local_c] != local_75[local_c]) break;
    local_c = local_c + 1;
  }
```
The check compares user input to a value stored in local_75, which is dynamically generated at runtime. If it doesn't match, the program prints an error and exits.

## ‚úÇÔ∏è Patching Strategy
We found the assembly responsible for the comparison at:

```asm
00401b77: CMP DL, AL
00401b79: JZ  00401b91
```
‚úÖ Step 1: NOP the comparison
At 0x00401b77, we patched:

```asm
CMP DL, AL
```
to:
```asm
NOP
```
‚úÖ Step 2: Force the jump
At 0x00401b79, we patched:

```asm
JZ 00401b91
```
to:
```asm
JMP 00401b91
```
This guarantees the program always jumps to the success path, regardless of user input.

## üöÄ Execution
After exporting the patched binary:

```bash
chmod +x trove_patched
./trove_patched
Enter the secret: a
Flag: REDFOX{H00Ps-Lo0p5-1-LoV3-7H3m-@lL!}
```
Any input now results in the flag being printed.
